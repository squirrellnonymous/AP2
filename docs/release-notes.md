# Release Notes

## Session Paused - October 11, 2025

**Active Work:** Fixing grading UX in pathway-mini-quiz.html

**Issue:** Attempting to display inline color-coded feedback (green for correct vessels, red for incorrect) instead of long vertical feedback list. Current implementation not correctly mapping validation feedback indices to input field indices.

**Challenge:** Validation feedback is indexed by pathway position (non-empty vessels only), but we need to color-code all input fields (which may include empty fields).

**Files being modified:**
- `pathway-mini-quiz.html` - displayResults() function needs debugging

**Next session:** Debug the feedback index mapping logic to correctly apply colors to input fields based on validation results.

## October 11, 2025 - Pathway Mini Quiz Feature

### üÜï New Feature: Blood Vessel Pathway Practice

Created a new pathway mapping feature for extra credit practice - tracing blood vessel routes from one location to another.

**File:** `pathway-mini-quiz.html`

#### Features
- **Single-question practice format** - Quick, focused extra credit review
- **Dynamic pathway input**
  - Start with 3 input fields
  - Add/remove vessel fields as needed
  - Enter key navigation between fields
  - Minimum 1 field always present
- **Smart validation**
  - Validates anatomical connections using vessel tree
  - Fuzzy name matching (handles typos, variations)
  - Partial credit scoring per valid connection
  - Detailed feedback showing where pathway breaks
- **Question example:** "How would blood get from the heart to the right hand?"
- **Full dark mode support**
- **Try Again** button for repeated practice

#### Core Infrastructure

**Pathway Validator** (`js/pathway-validator.js`)
- Validates sequential pathways against connection tree
- Flexible design - works for any connected system (vessels, nerves, metabolic pathways, etc.)
- Handles anatomically valid shortcuts (e.g., "aorta" ‚Üí "brachiocephalic trunk")

**Vessel Connection Tree** (`data/vessel-connections.yml`)
- Maps all blood vessel connections
- Separate arterial and venous trees
- Includes shortcuts for flexibility (skip descriptive terms, not anatomical structures)

#### Design Decisions
- Arterial paths start with: "aorta", "ascending aorta", or "heart"
- Venous paths end at: "right atrium" or "heart"
- Shortcuts allow skipping intermediate labels but not actual vessels
- Scoring: Partial credit per valid connection

#### Use Cases
- Extra credit practice for vessel pathway questions
- Quick review before practicals/exams
- Helps students learn valid blood flow routes
- Refresh page for new random question

#### Additional Files Created
- `pathway-test.html` - Development/testing page
- `pathway-practical.html` - Multi-question demo
- Question added to `unit2-part2-practical.yml` (id: 200)
