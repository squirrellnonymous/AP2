# Release Notes

## October 28, 2025 - ‚ùå False Alarm: Firefox Emulation Artifact (Not a Bug)

### Flashcard "Regression" Resolved - Browser Emulation Issue

**Status:** ‚ùå VOID - Not a real bug

**What Happened:**
Regular image flashcards appeared to have glitchy flip animations when tested in Firefox desktop with mobile emulation. After investigation, determined this was a **browser rendering artifact**, not an actual bug.

**Root Cause:**
Firefox desktop rendering of CSS 3D transforms differs significantly from actual mobile Safari/Chrome. Desktop browsers emulating mobile viewport sizes do not replicate the actual mobile rendering pipeline, particularly for `backface-visibility`, z-index layering, and hardware-accelerated 3D transforms.

**Resolution:**
Flashcards work correctly on real mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome). No code changes needed. The CSS z-index fix from October 27 is functioning as intended for the target platform.

**Lesson Learned:**
Always test on actual mobile devices for mobile-specific features, not just desktop browser emulation. Desktop emulation can show false positives for CSS 3D transform issues.

## October 28, 2025 - Text Overlay Rendering Refactored to Shared Module

### üîß Code Refactoring: Unified Text-Overlay Question Rendering

Consolidated duplicate text-overlay rendering code between mini-quiz-builder and practice practicals into a single shared module, ensuring consistent styling and behavior across all quiz types.

**Files Updated:**
- `mini-quiz-builder.html` - Now uses `renderQuestion()` from shared module
- `practical-template.html` - Now uses `renderQuestion()` from shared module (2 locations)
- `js/question-renderer.js` - Already contained the working implementation

#### Problem Solved

**Code Duplication**
- Mini-quiz-builder had ~50 lines of text-overlay rendering code
- Practical-template had the same code duplicated in 2 places (`showImage()` and `showExtraCreditImage()`)
- Total: ~150 lines of duplicate code
- Changes needed to be made in 3 places for consistency
- Risk of implementations diverging over time

**Inconsistent Text-Overlay Support**
- Mini-quiz had working text-overlay questions (text centered over gradient images)
- Practicals had no text-overlay support (only handled regular image questions)
- Different visual styling between quiz types
- Confusing for students switching between tools

#### Solution: Shared `renderQuestion()` Module

**What Changed**
All question rendering now goes through `js/question-renderer.js`:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (mini-quiz-builder.html) - ~50 lines
if (question.image) {
    const imagePath = `images/${question.image}`;
    imageElement.src = imagePath;
    if (question.textOverlay) {
        imageContainer.classList.add('has-text-overlay');
        questionTextElement.innerHTML = `<div class="question-text-overlay">${question.question}</div>`;
        // ... spacer logic ...
    } else {
        questionTextElement.innerHTML = question.question || '';
    }
} else {
    // text-only question rendering ...
}

// NEW CODE - 1 line
renderQuestion(question, imageElement, questionTextElement);
```

**Code Reduction**
- Mini-quiz: ~50 lines ‚Üí 1 line (98% reduction)
- Practical (showImage): ~30 lines ‚Üí 1 line + click handlers (97% reduction)
- Practical (showExtraCreditImage): ~30 lines ‚Üí 1 line + click handlers (97% reduction)
- Total: ~150 lines of duplicate code eliminated

#### Benefits

**DRY Principle Achieved**
- Single source of truth for question rendering logic
- One place to fix bugs or add features
- Consistent behavior across all quiz/practical tools
- Reduced maintenance burden

**Consistent Text-Overlay Support**
- Mini-quizzes and practicals now render text-overlay questions identically
- Same CSS classes (`has-text-overlay`, `question-text-overlay`) used everywhere
- Uniform visual styling with white text, dark shadow, centered positioning
- Layout spacer system works consistently across all tools

**Better Code Architecture**
- Clear separation of concerns: rendering logic separate from UI control
- Reusable across future quiz/practical features
- Easier to test and debug rendering issues
- Self-documenting code with clear function purpose

#### Technical Implementation

**How `renderQuestion()` Works**

The shared function handles three question types:

1. **Image questions with text below** (`question.image`, no `textOverlay`)
   - Displays image
   - Shows question text below image
   - Normal layout flow

2. **Text-overlay questions** (`question.image` + `question.textOverlay`)
   - Displays gradient/texture image as background
   - Overlays question text centered on image (absolutely positioned)
   - Adds spacer div to maintain consistent layout height
   - Uses CSS classes: `has-text-overlay`, `question-text-overlay`

3. **Text-only questions** (no `question.image`)
   - Displays themed text box with gradient background
   - Uses theme classes from YAML data
   - Fixed height matching image questions

**Layout Spacer System**
```javascript
// Create spacer to reserve space where text would normally appear
let spacer = imageContainer.querySelector('.text-overlay-spacer');
if (!spacer) {
    spacer = document.createElement('div');
    spacer.className = 'text-overlay-spacer';
    questionTextElement.parentNode.insertBefore(spacer, questionTextElement.nextSibling);
}
```

The spacer maintains layout consistency so the answer box doesn't jump when switching between question types.

#### CSS Architecture

**Shared Styles** (`css/practical.css` + `css/themes.css`)

All quiz/practical pages load the same CSS files:
- `css/practical.css` - Layout, spacing, positioning rules
- `css/themes.css` - Text-overlay styling and theme definitions

```css
/* Positioning context for text overlays */
.image-container.has-text-overlay .image-content {
    position: relative;
}

/* Absolutely positioned text over image */
.image-container.has-text-overlay .question-text {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    height: 450px;
    margin: 0;
    pointer-events: none;
}

/* The actual overlay text styling */
.question-text-overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    color: white;
    font-size: 2rem;
    font-weight: 600;
    text-align: center;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    width: 80%;
}
```

#### Files Now Using Shared Rendering

**Mini Quiz Builder** (`mini-quiz-builder.html`)
- Line 698: `renderQuestion(question, imageElement, questionTextElement);`
- Removed ~50 lines of duplicate rendering code
- Text-overlay questions now work identically to practicals

**Practice Practicals** (`practical-template.html`)
- Line 421: Main question rendering uses shared module
- Line 519: Extra credit question rendering uses shared module
- Removed ~60 lines of duplicate code
- Now supports text-overlay questions (previously didn't)

#### Use Cases

**Text-Overlay Questions in Practicals**
Now practicals can include questions like:
```yaml
- id: 101
  image: "gradients/02.jpg"  # Teal-blue gradient
  question: "What is Henry's Law?"
  answer: ["Henry's Law"]
  textOverlay: true
```

**Consistent Student Experience**
- Text-overlay questions look identical across all quiz types
- Same white text with shadow over gradient backgrounds
- Predictable layout and spacing
- Easier to learn, less cognitive load

**Easier Content Creation**
- YAML format for text-overlay questions works everywhere
- No need to consider which tool will display it
- Gradients/textures can be reused across quiz types
- Consistent visual branding

#### Testing Completed

‚úÖ Mini-quiz text-overlay questions display correctly
‚úÖ Text appears centered over gradient images
‚úÖ Answer box position relatively stable (minor variations expected)
‚úÖ Practical-template ready for text-overlay questions
‚úÖ Extra credit questions support text-overlay format
‚úÖ Dark mode works correctly for text-overlays

#### Next Steps

**Potential Improvements**
- Fine-tune spacer height to minimize answer box jumping
- Consider fixed answer box position for perfect consistency
- Test with various question text lengths
- Add more gradient/texture background images

**Content Opportunities**
- Convert existing text-only practical questions to text-overlay format
- Create new gradient backgrounds for visual variety
- Use texture images (notebook paper, chalkboard) for themed questions

## October 27, 2025 (Evening) - Fixed Text Overlay Pop-In During Flip Animation

### üêõ Bug Fix: Text Overlay Now Visible Throughout Flip Animation

Fixed a glitchy behavior where text overlays on flashcards (like "Henry's Law") would pop into visibility after the flip animation instead of being visible throughout the rotation. The text now feels physically present on the card during the entire flip.

**File Updated:**
- `flashcards/flashcard-engine.js` lines 605-614 - Removed 300ms delay for text overlay appearance

#### Problem
- When flipping from back to front on text-overlay cards, the question text was not immediately visible
- Text would "pop in" after the flip animation completed (at 300ms)
- This created a jarring effect where the text felt like it was being added after the flip rather than being physically present on the card
- Front-to-back flips looked good, but back-to-front flips looked wrong

#### Root Cause
The previous fix (see October 27 morning entry) added a 300ms delay before showing the text overlay when flipping back to front. This delay was intended to prevent text from showing through during rotation, but it created a worse problem: the text appeared to "pop in" rather than rotate smoothly with the card.

#### Solution
**Trust CSS backface-visibility** - Remove the manual 300ms delay and let CSS handle the visibility:
1. Show the text overlay immediately before removing the 'flipped' class
2. The CSS `backface-visibility: hidden` property on `.flip-card-front` ensures the overlay is hidden when the card is rotated away (180deg)
3. As the card rotates from 180deg back to 0deg, the overlay naturally becomes visible with the front face
4. No manual timing delays needed - the browser handles it correctly

#### Code Change
```javascript
// OLD CODE (with delay):
} else {
    // Flip back to show term
    cardElement.classList.remove('flipped');
    showingDefinition = false;

    if (overlay) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            overlay.style.display = '';
        }, 300); // Show halfway through animation
    }
}

// NEW CODE (immediate):
} else {
    // Flip back to show term
    // Show text overlay BEFORE flipping so it's visible during rotation
    if (overlay) {
        overlay.style.display = '';
    }

    cardElement.classList.remove('flipped');
    showingDefinition = false;
}
```

#### Result
- Text overlays are now visible throughout the flip animation
- Text feels physically present on the card, not added after the fact
- Smooth rotation with text squishing/unsquishing naturally
- Matches the good behavior of front-to-back flips

---

## October 27, 2025 (Morning) - Fixed Flashcard Flip Animation on Mobile

### üêõ Bug Fix: Smooth Flip Animation Without Image Flash

Fixed visual glitches in the flashcard flip animation on mobile devices. The card now smoothly rotates with the full 3D "squished" effect visible, and images no longer flash before the animation completes.

**Files Updated:**
- `flashcards/flashcard-engine.js` lines 610-616 - Added 300ms delay for text overlay appearance
- `flashcards/flashcard-styles.css` lines 188-215 - Added z-index control for proper face layering

#### Problem
- When flipping from back to front on mobile, the image would flash into view before the rotation animation started
- The 3D rotation animation appeared to disappear or card content would change instantly
- Text overlays appeared immediately, breaking the flip illusion

#### Root Cause
Mobile Safari has inconsistent handling of CSS `backface-visibility`, causing front face content to show through during rotation. Text overlays were being displayed immediately when the flip began, before the card rotated into view.

#### Solution
1. **Delayed text overlay timing** - Text overlays now wait 300ms before appearing when flipping back to front (halfway through the 0.6s rotation)
2. **Z-index layering** - Front face has `z-index: 2` by default, back face gets `z-index: 2` when flipped, ensuring correct face stays visible
3. **Removed opacity interference** - Let natural CSS 3D transforms handle the animation instead of opacity fades

#### Result
- Smooth 3D flip animation visible throughout
- No image flash when flipping back to front
- Text overlays appear at the right moment
- Works reliably on iOS Safari and Android Chrome

## October 27, 2025 - Dynamic Font Sizing for Flashcard Questions

### üé® Feature: Smart Font Sizing Based on Text Length

Implemented dynamic font sizing for flashcard questions that automatically adjusts based on text length, making short questions prominent and ensuring long questions remain readable.

**Files Updated:**
- `flashcards/flashcard-engine.js` - Added dynamic font sizing logic for both text-only and text overlay questions
- `css/themes.css` - Removed static font-size declarations to allow JavaScript control
- `flashcards/flashcard-styles.css` - Increased container width temporarily (later reverted)

#### Problem Solved

**Inconsistent Text Sizing**
- Short questions like "What is Boyle's Law?" were displayed at the same size as long questions
- Medium-length questions had awkward line wrapping and narrow appearance
- No visual hierarchy to emphasize punchy short questions
- Static CSS couldn't adapt to varying question lengths

#### Solution: JavaScript-Controlled Dynamic Font Sizing

**Implementation Details**

Both text-only questions (`.text-only-question-box`) and text overlay questions (`.question-text-overlay`) now use the same dynamic sizing logic:

```javascript
// Dynamic font sizing based on text length
const textLength = card.term.length;
if (textLength <= 25) {
    element.style.setProperty('font-size', '3rem', 'important');    // Large for short questions
} else if (textLength <= 45) {
    element.style.setProperty('font-size', '2.5rem', 'important');  // Medium-large
} else if (textLength <= 70) {
    element.style.setProperty('font-size', '2.1rem', 'important');  // Medium for moderate length
} else if (textLength <= 100) {
    element.style.setProperty('font-size', '1.8rem', 'important');  // Smaller for longer questions
} else {
    element.style.setProperty('font-size', '1.5rem', 'important');  // Smallest for very long questions
}
```

**Font Size Progression:**
- **‚â§25 characters**: 3rem - Large and prominent (e.g., "What is Boyle's Law?" = 21 chars)
- **26-45 characters**: 2.5rem - Still large and readable
- **46-70 characters**: 2.1rem - Medium (e.g., "What is the purpose of the cilia and goblet cells in the trachea?" = 66 chars)
- **71-100 characters**: 1.8rem - Slightly smaller but still comfortable
- **>100 characters**: 1.5rem - Smallest size for very long questions

#### CSS Changes Required

**Removed Static Font Sizes**
- Removed `font-size: 2rem` from all theme classes (`.text-only-theme-default`, `.text-only-theme-blk-wht`, etc.)
- Removed `!important` overrides from mobile media queries that blocked JavaScript control
- Cleaned up conflicting CSS that prevented dynamic sizing

**Text Overlay Width Fix**
- Changed `.question-text-overlay` from `max-width: 95%` to `width: 80%`
- Fixed issue where absolutely positioned overlay was shrinking to ~300px instead of filling available space
- Text now uses proper line width for better readability

#### Technical Implementation

**Two Code Paths Updated**
1. **Text-only cards** (no image) - Lines 404-420 in `flashcard-engine.js`
2. **Text overlay cards** (text on gradient images) - Lines 487-499 in `flashcard-engine.js`

Both paths now use identical sizing logic to ensure consistency across all flashcard types.

**CSS Specificity with `!important`**
- JavaScript uses `element.style.setProperty('font-size', '3rem', 'important')` to override any remaining CSS
- Ensures dynamic sizing works regardless of CSS cascade

#### Benefits

**Better Visual Hierarchy**
- Short, punchy questions stand out prominently
- Gradual size reduction feels natural and readable
- Long questions still fit comfortably without feeling cramped

**Improved Readability**
- Medium-length questions now have appropriate line width (80% container width)
- Better line breaks with more natural text flow
- Consistent experience across text-only and text overlay questions

**Smarter Adaptation**
- Automatically handles any question length
- No manual CSS tweaking needed per question
- Works for both flashcard types (text-only and text overlay)

#### Architecture Notes

**Text Overlay vs Text-Only**
- **Text overlay** (`textOverlay: true` in YAML): Text displayed over gradient background images using `.question-text-overlay` class
- **Text-only** (no image): Text displayed in themed colored boxes using `.text-only-question-box` class
- Both are actively used features with different visual styles but now share font sizing logic

**Not Legacy Code**
The text overlay feature is actively used for questions like Unit 3 flashcards (Boyle's Law, Dalton's Law, Henry's Law, etc.) where gradient backgrounds provide visual interest without distracting from the text.

---

## October 27, 2025 - Flashcard Text Overlay Feature: Background Images for Text Questions

### üé® New Feature: Text Overlay Questions with Background Images

Implemented a new approach for text-only questions in flashcards that uses background images with overlaid text instead of CSS-themed colored boxes. This solves mobile layout issues and creates consistent sizing across all question types.

**Files Updated:**
- `css/themes.css` - Added text overlay styles
- `flashcards/flashcard-styles.css` - Enhanced image container handling
- `flashcards/flashcard-engine.js` - Added text overlay detection and rendering

#### Problem Solved

**Mobile Layout Issues**
- Text-only questions had inconsistent sizing compared to image questions
- Modal view showed text-only questions much larger than image questions
- Complex CSS was needed to try to match sizes between different question types
- Different code paths for rendering text vs image questions

#### Solution: Background Images with Text Overlays

**New YAML Format**
```yaml
# Old text-only format (still supported)
- id: 42
  question: "What is the mitral valve also known as?"
  answer: ["bicuspid valve"]
  theme: "blue-gradient"

# New background image format with text overlay
- id: 42
  image: "practical4/101.jpg"  # gradient background image
  question: "What is the mitral valve also known as?"
  answer: ["bicuspid valve"]
  textOverlay: true
```

#### Benefits

**Perfect Size Consistency**
- All questions now use the same image container (same dimensions)
- No more size discrepancies between text and image questions
- Single code path for rendering all question types
- Simplified CSS without complex height-matching logic

**Better Mobile Experience**
- Text overlays scale responsively with `clamp()` sizing
- Background images fill the card space properly
- Text remains readable at all screen sizes
- Consistent visual experience across devices

**Visual Interest**
- Gradient backgrounds are more engaging than plain colored boxes
- Maintains visual variety with different gradient styles
- Better memory retention through visual association
- Professional, polished appearance

**Simpler Code**
- Eliminates complex text-only vs image question distinction in CSS
- One rendering path handles all questions
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Future-proof architecture

#### CSS Implementation

**Text Overlay Styles** (`css/themes.css`)
```css
.question-text-overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    color: white;
    font-size: 2rem;
    font-weight: 600;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 40px;
    max-width: 85%;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    line-height: 1.4;
}
```

**Mobile Responsive Sizing**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .question-text-overlay {
        font-size: clamp(1.3rem, 4.5vw, 1.8rem);
        padding: 20px;
        max-width: 90%;
        text-shadow: 2px 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript Detection

The flashcard engine now detects `textOverlay: true` in question data and automatically:
1. Displays the background image
2. Positions the question text as an overlay on the image
3. Adds `has-text-overlay` class to image container for proper styling
4. Handles loading states and preloading like regular image questions

#### Backward Compatibility

**Old format still works:**
- Questions without `textOverlay` flag render normally
- Text-only questions with `theme` field use colored box styling
- No breaking changes to existing flashcard decks
- Gradual migration path

#### Creating Background Images

**Gradient Images**
- Same dimensions as practical images (1024x768 recommended)
- Examples: `images/practical4/101.jpg` (teal-blue gradient), `images/practical4/102.jpg` (warm tan-orange gradient)
- Can create various styles: gradients, patterns, subtle textures, notebook paper, chalkboard, etc.
- Text overlay automatically handles contrast with text shadow

#### Use Cases

1. **Consistent flashcard sizing** - All questions look uniform in mobile and desktop views
2. **Better modal experience** - Review modals show consistent sizes for all question types
3. **Visual variety** - Different backgrounds help with memory association
4. **Easier theming** - Just swap background images instead of managing CSS theme classes
5. **Future flexibility** - Can use photos, patterns, or any visual background

#### Migration Path

1. Create gradient/background images at 1024x768 dimensions
2. Update YAML files to add `image` path and `textOverlay: true` flag to text-only questions
3. Remove old `theme` field (optional - still works if present)
4. Test in flashcard view and modal review
5. Once migrated, can remove deprecated text-only CSS classes

#### Technical Notes

- Text overlay uses absolute positioning within relative image container
- Z-index ensures text appears above image
- Text shadow provides contrast on any background
- Responsive `clamp()` sizing ensures readability on all devices
- Image preloading works identically to regular image questions

## October 24, 2025 - Pathway Quiz Data and Logic Fixes

### üêõ Bug Fixes and Data Corrections

**Files Updated:** `js/pathway-validator.js`, `js/fuzzy-matcher.js`, `data/vessel-connections.yml`, `data/pathway-questions.yml`, `pathway-mini-quiz.html`

Fixed various data errors and logic issues in the vessels pathway quiz to improve accuracy and reliability of pathway validation.

### üìù Documentation Workflow Improvement

**File Updated:** `CLAUDE.md`

Added a workflow section establishing documentation as a required final step when implementing features or fixing bugs. This ensures work is documented incrementally throughout sessions, avoiding large context usage at the end of sessions when trying to reconstruct what was done.

---

## October 24, 2025 - Pathway Quiz Major Improvements

### üéØ Pathway Validator Enhancements

Significantly improved the pathway mini quiz grading and feedback system with better error messages and scoring.

**Files Updated:** `js/pathway-validator.js`, `js/fuzzy-matcher.js`, `data/vessel-connections.yml`, `data/pathway-questions.yml` (image paths)

#### Grading System: Always 2 Points Maximum

**2-Point Scoring System**
- All pathway questions now scaled to exactly **2.0 points maximum**
- Proportional scoring based on pathway length
- Examples:
  - 5-vessel pathway with all correct = 6 raw points ‚Üí **2.0/2.0 points** (100%)
  - 5-vessel pathway with 1 typo = 5.5 raw points ‚Üí **1.8/2.0 points** (92%)
  - 10-vessel pathway with all correct = 11 raw points ‚Üí **2.0/2.0 points** (100%)
  - 10-vessel pathway with 2 typos = 10 raw points ‚Üí **1.8/2.0 points** (91%)
- Maintains proportional partial credit for typos (-0.5 per misspelling)
- Zero points if pathway is fundamentally wrong (skipped vessel, wrong connection)

**Implementation**
- Raw score calculation: 1 point per vessel + 0.5 for typos + 1 for reaching endpoint
- Scaling factor: `2.0 / rawMaxScore`
- Final score rounded to 1 decimal place
- Display: "Score: 1.8/2 pts (90%)"

#### Error Messages: No More Answer Giveaways

**Problem Fixed**
- Error messages were revealing the correct answers
- Students could keep guessing until the hint told them what to add
- Reduced learning opportunity and critical thinking

**New Error Messages**

1. **Invalid vessel name** ‚úÖ (NEW)
   - Before: Listed all valid connections
   - Now: `"{vessel}" is not a blood vessel. Check the name and try again."`
   - Example: `"left posterior popliteal artery" is not a blood vessel. Check the name and try again.`

2. **Skipped vessel** ‚úÖ (IMPROVED)
   - Before: `You skipped "right external iliac artery".`
   - Now: `"right femoral artery" doesn't connect directly to "right common iliac artery". You skipped an artery. Check the connection and try again.`
   - Tells students they're close without revealing which vessel was skipped

3. **Wrong vessel type** ‚úÖ (unchanged - already good)
   - Message: `"{vessel}" is a vein, not an artery."`
   - Educational feedback for common confusion

4. **Vessel doesn't connect** ‚úÖ (IMPROVED)
   - Before: `Try going through the left popliteal artery next.`
   - Before: `From "X", you can go to "Y", "Z".`
   - Now: `"{currentNode}" doesn't connect to "{nextNode}". Check the connection and try again."`
   - No longer reveals valid next vessels

**Educational Benefits**
- Students must think through anatomy themselves
- Active learning and problem-solving encouraged
- Better retention when students figure it out
- Reduced "guess until hint tells you" strategy

#### Fuzzy Matcher: Distinct Vessel Names

**Enhanced Medical Opposites List**
- Added comprehensive vessel-specific anatomical terms that should NEVER be considered similar
- Prevents false matches like "radial" ‚âà "brachial"

**New Anatomical Term Pairs (66 new entries)**
- **Arm/Upper Limb**: radial ‚â† ulnar ‚â† brachial ‚â† axillary
- **Arm Veins**: basilic ‚â† cephalic ‚â† cubital
- **Leg/Lower Limb**: femoral ‚â† popliteal ‚â† tibial ‚â† fibular
- **Leg Veins**: saphenous ‚â† femoral ‚â† popliteal ‚â† tibial
- **Head/Neck**: carotid ‚â† subclavian ‚â† jugular ‚â† vertebral
- **Abdomen**: celiac ‚â† mesenteric ‚â† renal, hepatic ‚â† splenic ‚â† gastric
- **Brain**: cerebral ‚â† cerebellar ‚â† basilar

**How It Works**
- Before calculating similarity, checks if vessel names are in opposites list
- If found: Returns 0 (zero credit) immediately
- No partial credit for completely different vessels
- Example: "radial artery" vs "brachial artery" ‚Üí 0 points (not 0.5)

#### Vessel Connection Updates

**Great Saphenous Vein Shortcut**
- Added direct connection: great saphenous vein ‚Üí external iliac vein
- Allows skipping common femoral vein
- Applies to both right and left sides
- More anatomically flexible pathway validation

**Data File Updates**
- `data/vessel-connections.yml`: Added saphenous vein shortcuts with comments
- `data/pathway-questions.yml`: Fixed image paths for consistency

### üîÑ "Try Again" Feature: Preserve Correct Answers

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented

**Description**
When students click "Try Again" after getting a pathway wrong, the correct vessels are preserved so they can continue from where they made a mistake.

**Features Implemented**
- Preserves all correctly validated vessels (green styling, read-only)
- Clears only fields after the first error
- Auto-focuses cursor on first editable field
- Remove buttons hidden for preserved vessels
- Full dark mode support for preserved inputs (emerald green backgrounds)

**How It Works**
1. Captures original pathway BEFORE clearing inputs (bug fix)
2. Finds first error in validation feedback
3. Re-creates input fields up to error point with correct values
4. Marks preserved fields as read-only with green styling
5. Adds empty fields for student to fix error and continue

**Example**
- Student enters: aorta ‚úì, descending aorta ‚úì, left common iliac ‚úì, femoral artery ‚úó
- "Try Again" preserves: aorta, descending aorta, left common iliac (green, locked)
- Cursor focuses on field 4 (empty, editable)
- Student adds missing "left external iliac artery" and continues

**Educational Benefits**
- Productive failure - learn from mistakes without losing progress
- Scaffolding - correct portions provide foundation
- Reduced frustration - don't re-type correct vessels
- Faster iteration - quick retry cycles improve learning

#### Bug Fixes

**"Try Again" Clear Bug Fixed**
- Problem: Calling `getPathway()` after clearing inputs returned empty array
- Solution: Capture pathway BEFORE clearing `innerHTML`
- Now correctly preserves vessels when retrying

### üìù Documentation Updates

**Updated `docs/features-and-bugs.md`**
- Marked "Preserve Correct Answers on Try Again" as ‚úÖ Implemented (completed 2025-10-24)
- Added new feature request: "Pathway Validator: Improve Error Messages to Not Give Away Answers"
  - Status: ‚úÖ Implemented (completed same session)
  - Documented all error message improvements
  - Listed educational benefits and technical considerations

**Image Path Corrections**
- User updated some incorrectly linked images in pathway question data
- Fixed image references for consistency

## October 18, 2025 - Flashcard Image Loading Fix & Blood Vessels Content

### üêõ Fixed Flashcard Image Loading Flash

**Files:** `flashcards/flashcard-engine.js`, `flashcards/flashcard-styles.css`

Fixed a jarring black/dark flash when navigating between flashcards.

#### Problem
- Images showed dark gray body background during transitions
- 1ms delay before displaying preloaded images caused visible flash
- Poor user experience during card navigation

#### Root Causes
1. **Missing background color** - `.image-container` had no background, so dark page background (`#374151`) showed through
2. **Unnecessary setTimeout** - 1ms delay before showing preloaded images even when already cached

#### Solution
1. **Added white background** - `flashcards/flashcard-styles.css:272`
   - Set `background-color: #ffffff` on `.image-container`
   - White background shows during loading instead of dark page background

2. **Removed setTimeout delay** - `flashcards/flashcard-engine.js:416-419`
   - Changed from `setTimeout(() => { termImage.src = ... }, 1)` to immediate assignment
   - Preloaded images display instantly without delay
   - Images already loaded in memory, no delay needed

#### Result
- Smooth transitions between flashcards with no visible flash
- Clean white background during brief loading moments
- Better user experience during card navigation
- Preloading system now works as intended

- **Question 66**: "What is the structure labeled Z?" ‚Üí Left renal artery

#### Content Details
- All three questions reference the same internal organ anatomical model
- Labels X, Y, Z identify different vessels on kidneys and liver
- Each includes comprehensive educational definitions
- Tagged with: `blood-vessels`, `vein`/`artery`, `models`, `internal-organ-model`

#### Educational Value
- **Hepatic portal vein**: Light purple vessel carrying nutrient-rich blood to liver (portal system)
- **Right renal vein**: Blue vessel draining right kidney to IVC
- **Left renal artery**: Red vessel supplying oxygenated blood to left kidney

#### Total Content
Practice Practical #3 now includes:
- **66 image-based questions** (id: 1-67, excluding gap at 63)
- **17 text-only questions** (id: 100-116)
- **83 total questions** for comprehensive blood vessels practice

---

### üìã Feature Request: Question Grouping

**File:** `docs/features-and-bugs.md`

Documented new feature request for question grouping in practice practicals.

#### Proposed Feature
Keep related questions together in sequential order during randomization (e.g., X, Y, Z labels on same image).

#### Configuration Format
```yaml
- id: 64
  question: "What is the structure labeled X?"
  group: "internal-organs-1"

- id: 65
  question: "What is the structure labeled Y?"
  group: "internal-organs-1"

- id: 66
  question: "What is the structure labeled Z?"
  group: "internal-organs-1"
```

#### Expected Behavior
- Questions within a group stay together and in order
- Groups randomize as single units among other questions
- Backward compatible with existing questions
- Works with tag balancing and other features

#### Use Cases
- Multi-label images (X, Y, Z on same model)
- Sequential processes that build on each other
- Comparative questions about related structures
- Case studies with multiple related questions

#### Priority
Medium - Enhances UX for multi-part questions but not blocking.

## October 15, 2025 - Flashcard Mobile Image Crop Fix

### üñºÔ∏è Fixed Mobile Image Cropping to Preserve Top/Bottom Anatomy

**File:** `flashcards/flashcard-styles.css`

Fixed an issue where flashcard images on mobile devices were cropping important anatomy and arrows at the top and bottom of images.

#### Problem
- Mobile view was using `object-fit: cover` with `transform: scale(1.25)`
- This caused aggressive cropping that cut off arrows and anatomical structures at top/bottom
- Made vessel identification difficult when key features were hidden

#### Solution
Implemented height-based image sizing that crops sides only:
- **Fixed height:** `420px` - fills the available white space in the card
- **Auto width:** `width: auto` - lets width adjust based on image aspect ratio
- **Minimum width:** `min-width: 100%` - ensures image spans full container width (often exceeds, allowing side cropping)
- **Object-fit:** `cover` - fills the 420px height while maintaining aspect ratio
- **Centered:** `object-position: center` - crops sides evenly
- Combined with `.image-container` having `overflow: hidden`, sides get clipped while preserving top/bottom content

#### Result
- Images now fill the mobile card space effectively
- All anatomy and arrows at top/bottom are fully visible
- Side cropping provides zoom effect without losing critical content
- Better learning experience for vessel identification

## October 12, 2025 - Pathway Mini Quiz Advanced Refinements

### üéØ Major Enhancements to Pathway Validation System

Significantly improved the pathway quiz with intelligent feedback, partial credit for typos, and contextual guidance.

**Files Updated:** `js/pathway-validator.js`, `pathway-mini-quiz.html`, `data/pathway-questions.yml`, `data/vessel-connections.yml`

#### Advanced Features Implemented

**Partial Credit for Typos (Yellow Highlighting)**
- **FuzzyMatcher integration**: Detects minor spelling errors and awards 0.5 points
- **Visual feedback**: Yellow arrows (‚Äî¬Ω‚Üí) and yellow input backgrounds for typos
- **Corrected pathway tracking**: Typos don't break the chain - validator uses corrected names for subsequent validation
- **Example**: "right redial artery" ‚Üí 0.5 points, feedback shows "should be 'right radial artery'"
- **Scoring**: Each vessel = 1.0 point, typos = 0.5 points, wrong = 0 points

**Intelligent Contextual Feedback**
- **Skipped vessel detection**: "You skipped 'right femoral artery'."
- **Artery/vein confusion**: "'right femoral vein' is a vein, not an artery."
- **Pathfinding guidance**: Uses breadth-first search to identify vessels that lead toward the destination
- **Conversational tone**: Natural language feedback like a helpful tutor
- **Example**: "The right foot doesn't connect directly to the descending aorta. Try going through the right common iliac artery next."

**Optional Descriptors Support**
- **Starting points**: "heart", "left ventricle", and "aortic semilunar valve" are optional prefixes before "aorta"
- **Endpoints**: "hand" and "foot" can be added after terminal arteries as optional descriptors
- **Anatomical positioning**: "aortic semilunar valve" must be in correct location if included
- **Endpoint validation**: Recognizes when valid endpoint was reached even if optional descriptor added after

**Enhanced Fuzzy Matching**
- **"descending aorta" fix**: No longer incorrectly matches plain "aorta"
- **Ascending shortcuts**: "aorta" can match "ascending aorta" but not "descending aorta"
- **Handles**: R/L abbreviations, "the" prefix, case differences, plurals

**Vessel Connection Updates**
- Removed "hand" and "foot" from valid endpoints list (now optional extensions only)
- Added "hand"/"foot" as valid connections FROM terminal arteries (radial, ulnar, tibial, fibular)
- 50+ arterial vessels, 40+ venous vessels mapped

#### Visual Improvements

**Color-Coded Feedback**
- Green checkmark arrows (‚Äî‚úì‚Üí) for correct vessels (1.0 point)
- Yellow half arrows (‚Äî¬Ω‚Üí) for typos (0.5 points)
- Red X arrows (‚Äî‚úó‚Üí) for incorrect vessels (0 points)
- Matching input field backgrounds (green/yellow/red)

**Current Questions** (4 pathway questions)
- Heart ‚Üí Right Hand (id: 200) - with image
- Heart ‚Üí Left Hand (id: 201) - with image
- Heart ‚Üí Right Foot (id: 202) - with image
- Heart ‚Üí Left Foot (id: 203) - with image
- Questions randomly selected on page load/refresh

#### Core Infrastructure

**Pathway Validator** (`js/pathway-validator.js`)
- Validates sequential pathways against connection tree
- **Fuzzy name matching**: Uses FuzzyMatcher.js for typo detection and partial credit
- **Pathfinding**: Breadth-first search to find vessels that lead to destination
- **Corrected pathway tracking**: Replaces typos with correct names for chain validation
- **Artery/vein detection**: Checks if student used wrong vessel type
- **Skipped vessel detection**: Identifies when student skipped an intermediate vessel
- **Contextual feedback**: Shows only the immediate next step toward destination
- Enhanced error messages in conversational tone

**Vessel Connection Tree** (`data/vessel-connections.yml`)
- Complete arterial and venous trees
- 50+ arterial vessels mapped with connections
- 40+ venous vessels mapped with connections
