## October 12, 2025 - Pathway Mini Quiz Advanced Refinements

### üéØ Major Enhancements to Pathway Validation System

Significantly improved the pathway quiz with intelligent feedback, partial credit for typos, and contextual guidance.

**Files Updated:** `js/pathway-validator.js`, `pathway-mini-quiz.html`, `data/pathway-questions.yml`, `data/vessel-connections.yml`

#### Advanced Features Implemented

**Partial Credit for Typos (Yellow Highlighting)**
- **FuzzyMatcher integration**: Detects minor spelling errors and awards 0.5 points
- **Visual feedback**: Yellow arrows (‚Äî¬Ω‚Üí) and yellow input backgrounds for typos
- **Corrected pathway tracking**: Typos don't break the chain - validator uses corrected names for subsequent validation
- **Example**: "right redial artery" ‚Üí 0.5 points, feedback shows "should be 'right radial artery'"
- **Scoring**: Each vessel = 1.0 point, typos = 0.5 points, wrong = 0 points

**Intelligent Contextual Feedback**
- **Skipped vessel detection**: "You skipped 'right femoral artery'."
- **Artery/vein confusion**: "'right femoral vein' is a vein, not an artery."
- **Pathfinding guidance**: Uses breadth-first search to identify vessels that lead toward the destination
- **Conversational tone**: Natural language feedback like a helpful tutor
- **Example**: "The right foot doesn't connect directly to the descending aorta. Try going through the right common iliac artery next."

**Optional Descriptors Support**
- **Starting points**: "heart", "left ventricle", and "aortic semilunar valve" are optional prefixes before "aorta"
- **Endpoints**: "hand" and "foot" can be added after terminal arteries as optional descriptors
- **Anatomical positioning**: "aortic semilunar valve" must be in correct location if included
- **Endpoint validation**: Recognizes when valid endpoint was reached even if optional descriptor added after

**Enhanced Fuzzy Matching**
- **"descending aorta" fix**: No longer incorrectly matches plain "aorta"
- **Ascending shortcuts**: "aorta" can match "ascending aorta" but not "descending aorta"
- **Handles**: R/L abbreviations, "the" prefix, case differences, plurals

**Vessel Connection Updates**
- Removed "hand" and "foot" from valid endpoints list (now optional extensions only)
- Added "hand"/"foot" as valid connections FROM terminal arteries (radial, ulnar, tibial, fibular)
- 50+ arterial vessels, 40+ venous vessels mapped

#### Visual Improvements

**Color-Coded Feedback**
- Green checkmark arrows (‚Äî‚úì‚Üí) for correct vessels (1.0 point)
- Yellow half arrows (‚Äî¬Ω‚Üí) for typos (0.5 points)
- Red X arrows (‚Äî‚úó‚Üí) for incorrect vessels (0 points)
- Matching input field backgrounds (green/yellow/red)

**Current Questions** (4 pathway questions)
- Heart ‚Üí Right Hand (id: 200) - with image
- Heart ‚Üí Left Hand (id: 201) - with image
- Heart ‚Üí Right Foot (id: 202) - with image
- Heart ‚Üí Left Foot (id: 203) - with image
- Questions randomly selected on page load/refresh

#### Core Infrastructure

**Pathway Validator** (`js/pathway-validator.js`)
- Validates sequential pathways against connection tree
- **Fuzzy name matching**: Uses FuzzyMatcher.js for typo detection and partial credit
- **Pathfinding**: Breadth-first search to find vessels that lead to destination
- **Corrected pathway tracking**: Replaces typos with correct names for chain validation
- **Artery/vein detection**: Checks if student used wrong vessel type
- **Skipped vessel detection**: Identifies when student skipped an intermediate vessel
- **Contextual feedback**: Shows only the immediate next step toward destination
- Enhanced error messages in conversational tone

**Vessel Connection Tree** (`data/vessel-connections.yml`)
- Complete arterial and venous trees
- 50+ arterial vessels mapped with connections
- 40+ venous vessels mapped with connections
- Optional descriptors: heart ‚Üí aorta, terminal arteries ‚Üí hand/foot
- Anatomically valid shortcuts included

#### Educational Philosophy
- **Productive failure**: Students learn from specific, helpful feedback
- **Partial credit**: Rewards understanding despite minor spelling errors
- **Contextual guidance**: Shows the correct path without giving away entire answer
- **Immediate feedback**: Try Again button for repeated practice
- **Progressive difficulty**: Can add optional vessels for extra detail

#### Core Infrastructure

**Pathway Validator** (`js/pathway-validator.js`)

- **Validated structure**: Custom validator checks for broken references

**YAML Validation System**
- Extended `scripts/validate-yaml.js` to handle pathway questions
- Pathway-specific validation:
  - Requires `direction` field (arterial/venous)
  - Requires `validStartVessels` array
  - Requires `validEndVessels` array
  - Accepts either question text OR image (or both)
- Vessel connections validation:
  - Checks arterial/venous tree structure
  - Reports vessel counts
  - Validates with dedicated `validate-vessels.js` script

**Vessel Connection Validator** (`validate-vessels.js`)
- Checks for broken references in vessel trees
- Ensures every vessel in a connection list exists or is a valid endpoint
- Run with: `node validate-vessels.js`

#### Design Decisions
- Arterial paths: Start with "aorta", "ascending aorta", "heart", or "left ventricle"
- Arterial endpoints: Accept specific arteries OR generic "hand"/"foot" for flexibility
- Shortcuts: Allow skipping intermediate descriptive labels, but not actual vessels
- Scoring: Partial credit per valid step + bonus for reaching correct endpoint
- Separated from practice practicals to avoid slowing down main quiz validation

#### Technical Improvements
- Pathway questions stored in separate `data/pathway-questions.yml` file
- Reusable pathway question type - can be used for any system (nerves, metabolic pathways, etc.)
- Fixed feedback index mapping bug for correct input field coloring
- Smart Tab/Enter key handling skips UI elements, focuses on content

#### Use Cases
- Extra credit practice for vessel pathway questions
- Learn valid blood flow routes step-by-step
- Immediate feedback on where pathway breaks
- Understand vessel connections through trial and error
