    term: "Identify the formed element"

    answer: "Neutrophil"
    keywords: ["most abundant", "polymorphonuclear", "PMN", "first responders", "bacterial infections"]
    definition: "The most abundant white blood cells (50-70%), first responders to bacterial infections with multilobed nuclei."
    breakdown: "Named for their neutral-staining granules. 'Neutro' means neutral, 'phil' means loving. They love neutral dyes!"
    example: "When you get a cut and bacteria try to invade, neutrophils are the first soldiers to arrive at the battle scene."

    term: "Identify the formed element"
    image: "leukocytes/02.jpg"
    answer: "Thrombocytes"
    keywords: ["platelets", "blood clotting", "hemostasis", "cell fragments", "megakaryocytes"]
    definition: "Cell fragments (platelets) essential for blood clotting and hemostasis, derived from megakaryocytes in bone marrow."
    breakdown: "'Thrombo' means clot, 'cyte' means cell. These aren't actually whole cells but fragments that stick together to form clots."
    example: "When you get a paper cut, thrombocytes (platelets) quickly stick to the damaged blood vessel and clump together to stop the bleeding."

    term: "Identify the formed element"
    image: "leukocytes/03.jpg"
    answer: "Lymphocyte"
    keywords: ["B cells", "T cells", "NK cells", "adaptive immunity", "memory"]
    definition: "White blood cells that differentiate into B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells for adaptive and innate immunity."
    breakdown: "'Lympho' refers to lymph fluid, 'cyte' means cell. These are the smart cells that remember past infections."
    example: "B cells make antibodies like custom-made keys, T cells kill infected cells directly, and NK cells patrol for anything suspicious."

    term: "Identify the formed element"
    image: "leukocytes/04.jpg"
    answer: "Basophil"
    keywords: ["least common", "histamine", "heparin", "allergic reactions", "mast cells", "blue granules"]
    definition: "The least common white blood cells with blue-staining granules that release histamine during allergic reactions, closely related to tissue mast cells."
    breakdown: "'Basic' refers to basic (alkaline) dyes that stain their granules blue. They're like circulating versions of mast cells."
    example: "When you're allergic to cats, basophils release histamine that makes your eyes water and nose run, working alongside mast cells in tissues."

    term: "Identify the formed element"
    image: "leukocytes/05.jpg"
    answer: "Monocyte"
    keywords: ["largest", "macrophages", "dendritic cells", "antigen presentation", "tissue repair"]
    definition: "The largest white blood cells that differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells in tissues."
    breakdown: "'Mono' means one, referring to their single large nucleus. They're like the heavy machinery of the immune system."
    example: "Think of them as construction workers that become either cleanup crews (macrophages) or information specialists (dendritic cells)."

    term: "Identify the formed element"
    image: "leukocytes/06.jpg"
    answer: "Eosinophil"
    keywords: ["eosinophil", "bilobed nucleus", "pink granules", "allergic reactions"]
    definition: "White blood cell with characteristic pink-staining granules and typically a bilobed nucleus."
    breakdown: "Look for the distinctive bright pink/red granules that fill the cytoplasm and the often bilobed (two-part) nucleus."
    example: "This eosinophil is identified by its pink-staining granules (eosinophilic granules) that respond to eosin dye, and its characteristic bilobed nucleus."
