    definition: "This plays out when blood coming into the lungs is relatively deoxygenated and can pick up O₂ from the alveolar air."

    question: "A patient with COPD has the following blood gas results: pH 7.32, PaCO₂ 58 mmHg, HCO₃⁻ 29 mEq/L. What is the acid-base imbalance?"
    answer: ["respiratory acidosis with partial compensation", "respiratory acidosis, partial compensation", "partially compensated respiratory acidosis"]
    definition: "Low pH (acidosis) + high CO₂ (respiratory cause) + elevated HCO₃⁻ (kidneys compensating by retaining bicarbonate). Partial compensation because pH hasn't returned to normal range yet."
