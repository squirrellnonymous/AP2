  - question: "The pituitary hormone that promotes testosterone development in testes and egg release in ovaries is"
    options:
      - "TSH"
      - "ACTH"
      - "FSH"
      - "LH"
    correct: 3
    info: luteinizing hormone stimulates: 1. ovulation, 2. production of progesterone in ovaries, and 3. production of testosterone in testes

essay:
  - question: "Can hormones target all cells of the body? Explain."
    answer: "No, hormones are not able to target all cells of the body. Hormones are only able to affect particular cells known as target cells. Target cells contain specific proteins, referred to as receptors, to which hormones can bind."
    points: 7
    
  - question: "Discuss the relationship between growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)."
    answer: "Growth hormone (GH) acts on the liver and other target tissues to promote the release of insulin-like growth factor (IGF). IGF carries out the long-term effects of GH. IGF acts on nearly every cell type in the body, and triggers rapid protein synthesis and cell division. IGF also decreases blood glucose concentration by stimulating glucose uptake by cells, an action opposite to acute GH release."

  - question: "Alcohol inhibits the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, or vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary. Determine why alcohol is a poor choice for rehydration when we are thirsty."
    answer: "The primary effect of ADH is to increase the amount of water retained by the kidneys in response to increasing solute concentration in the blood. A lack of ADH can occur when alcohol is consumed. An insufficient amount of ADH increases the risk for dehydration since the body is unable to retain most of the water that is consumed."

  - question: "List the cardinal signs of inflammation and what causes them."
    answer: "The cardinal signs of inflammation are redness, heat, swelling (edema), and pain. Redness and heat are caused by hyperemia (increased blood flow to the area caused by vasodilation from the release of histamines). Swelling is caused by increased capillary permeability (to allow for phagocytes to get to the site of infection). Pain is caused by bradykinin and prostaglandins."

  - question: "Nicole contracted the measles since she did not receive a vaccine. For each person, determine if active immunity or passive immunity is involved and explain why Clark benefitted from the vaccine."
    answer: "Both Clark and Nicole received active immunity through their contact with the measles virus. Active immunity may be received naturally through exposure to an antigen via infection or artificially via a vaccination. It results in the production of memory cells and large numbers of antibodies and is, therefore, relatively long-lasting, ranging from years to a lifetime. The benefit for Clark is he did not have to experience the disease to form immunological memory against it."

  - question: "Explain how a pathogen is recognized and attacked by BOTH the cell mediated and humoral responses. Include in your answer: the major cells, their jobs (chemical agents of attack), cytokines (interleukins), memory cells, MHC I and II, APC's, antibodies, effector cells). Also include in your answer how HIV impacts this system."
    answer: |
      Cell Mediated: If the pathogen enters a body cell, the MHC I presents the antigen. A cytotoxic T cell will bind to the cell (needs activation and costimulation too), release perforins and/or induce apoptosis to kill the diseased cell. The cytotoxic T cell had to be activated by a Helper T cell and will divide into effector cells and memory cells.

      Antibody Mediated: When pathogens are still in the body fluids, a B cell will attach to the antigen of the pathogen (sensitization), become activated by a helper T cell and divide to produce plasma cells and memory cells. The plasma cells will produce antibodies that will perform functions to decrease the possibility of those pathogens entering cells. These actions include: agglutination (clump cells), precipitation (clump antigens), neutralization (prevent toxins from spreading), opsonization (buttering them up for macrophages), complement activation (classical way), and stimulating inflammation.

      Helper T cells bind to an antigen on an MHC II molecule on an antigen-presenting cell. They release a co-stimulator and become activated. Once activated, they will secrete cytokines (interleukins) to activate macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and B cells. They are necessary to help activate all of the immune responses.

      HIV invades Helper T cells, which are responsible for activating both the cell-mediated and the humoral response. Our bodies will then kill those Helper T cells, which in turn makes it more difficult to mount an immune response to anything. Most individuals die from opportunistic infections that normal immune systems could destroy.
