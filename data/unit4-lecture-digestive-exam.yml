multipleChoice:
  - question: "Bringing nutrients into the body is the process of ________."
    options:
      - "Ingestion"
      - "Propulsion"
      - "Secretion"
      - "Absorption"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "Ingestion is bringing it into the alimentary canal (still outside the body). Propulsion moves it through the alimentary canal. Secretion is putting things into the alimentary canal (e.g. mucous, enzymes). **Absorption is the process of bringing things from the digestive tract into the blood (from ouside the body into the body)**."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "digestion"]

  - question: "Why is the alimentary canal technically considered 'outside' the body?"
    options:
      - "Because it contains bacteria and foreign substances"
      - "Because nutrients must be absorbed into the blood to enter the body"
      - "Because it has its own nervous system (enteric)"
      - "Because it is made of epithelial tissue"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The alimentary canal is a continuous tube from mouth to anus. Food inside this tube hasn't entered the body yet. **Absorption** is the process that brings nutrients from the digestive tract into the blood - that's when they actually enter the body."

  - question: "Which type of epithelium lines the oral cavity?"
    options:
      - "Simple columnar epithelium"
      - "Simple squamous epithelium"
      - "Non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium"
      - "Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The oral cavity and anus are both lined with **non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium**. This tissue constantly regenerates to handle abrasion, but isn't waterproof (non-keratinized). Everything in between is mostly simple columnar."

  - question: "Which type of saliva is produced continuously by the sympathetic nervous system?"
    options:
      - "Serous fluid"
      - "Mucous saliva"
      - "Amylase"
      - "Lingual lipase"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "**Mucous saliva** is continuously released by the sympathetic system all the time. Serous fluid (watery, enzyme-rich) is secreted by the parasympathetic system specifically when eating. This is why antihistamines (which block parasympathetic activity) cause dry, sticky mouth."

  - question: "Which of the following is NOT a function of the stomach?"
    options:
      - "Mechanical digestion through churning"
      - "Chemical digestion with pepsin and HCl"
      - "Nutrient absorption"
      - "Storage of food"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The stomach does NOT absorb nutrients (though it does absorb some water and alcohol). Its main functions are **storage** (expands to 2 liters), **mechanical digestion** (churning with 3 muscle layers), and **chemical digestion** (pepsin, HCl, gastric lipase). Nutrient absorption happens in the small intestine."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "stomach"]

  - question: "Which cells in the stomach produce hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor?"
    options:
      - "Chief cells"
      - "Parietal cells"
      - "Mucous cells"
      - "Enteroendocrine cells"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "**Parietal cells** secrete both HCl and intrinsic factor. Chief cells produce pepsinogen and gastric lipase. Mucous cells produce protective alkaline mucus. Enteroendocrine cells release gastrin hormone."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "stomach", "cells"]

  - question: "Where is the most vitamin B12 absorbed?"
    options:
      - "Large intestine"
      - "Duodenum"
      - "Ileum"
      - "Stomach"
      - "Jejunum"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the **ileum** (the last section of the small intestine). Intrinsic factor (produced by parietal cells in the stomach) binds to B12 in the stomach, and this complex travels to the ileum where it's absorbed into the bloodstream. This is why gastric bypass patients need B12 injections - they have fewer parietal cells producing intrinsic factor."

  - question: "What type of digestion is 'segmentation'?"
    options:
      - "Movement"
      - "Mechanical"
      - "Chemical"
      - "Propulsion"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "**Segmentation** is a type of **mechanical digestion** that occurs in the small intestine. It involves rhythmic contractions of circular muscles that mix chyme with digestive enzymes, physically breaking down food particles. This is different from chemical digestion (enzymatic breakdown) and propulsion (moving food along the tract)."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "digestion", "small-intestine"]

  - question: "Peristalsis is a form of _______."
    options:
      - "Secretion"
      - "Propulsion"
      - "Mechanical digestion"
      - "Absorption"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "**Peristalsis** is a form of **propulsion** - the process of moving food through the digestive tract. It consists of wave-like contractions of smooth muscle (circular and longitudinal layers) that push the bolus/chyme forward through the alimentary canal. Segmentation mixes food, but peristalsis moves it."

  - question: "What is something that the pancreas does NOT do?"
    options:
      - "Secretion of digestive enzymes"
      - "Release of hormones"
      - "Production of bicarbonate"
      - "Storage of food"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "The pancreas does NOT **store food** - that's the stomach's job. The pancreas is both an exocrine gland (secretes digestive enzymes like amylase, lipase, and proteases into the duodenum) and an endocrine gland (releases hormones like insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream). It also produces bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "pancreas"]

  - question: "Which of these is in pancreatic juice?"
    options:
      - "Pancreatic amylase"
      - "Trypsinogen"
      - "Chymotrypsinogen"
      - "Procarboxypeptidase"
      - "all of these"
      - "a, b, and c only"
    correct: 4
    explanation: "**All of these** are found in pancreatic juice. Trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypeptidase are all inactive enzyme precursors (zymogens) that digest proteins. They're secreted in inactive form to prevent the pancreas from digesting itself. Once in the small intestine, they're activated: trypsinogen → trypsin, chymotrypsinogen → chymotrypsin, and procarboxypeptidase → carboxypeptidase."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "pancreas", "enzymes"]

  - question: "Which enzyme activates trypsinogen into trypsin?"
    options:
      - "Pepsin"
      - "Enteropeptidase"
      - "Chymotrypsin"
      - "Carboxypeptidase"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "**Enteropeptidase** (also called enterokinase) is secreted by intestinal cells and activates trypsinogen into trypsin. This is the critical first step - once trypsin is activated, it then activates other pancreatic enzyme precursors like chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase in a cascade reaction."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "enzymes", "small-intestine"]

  - question: "What breaks down proteins?"
    options:
      - "Trypsin"
      - "Chymotrypsin"
      - "Carboxypeptidase"
      - "All of these"
      - "None of these"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "**All of these** break down proteins. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase are proteases (protein-digesting enzymes) that work in the small intestine. They're the activated forms of the zymogens (trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase) secreted by the pancreas. Together, they break proteins down into smaller peptides and amino acids for absorption."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "enzymes", "proteins"]

  - question: "What is broken down by procarboxypeptidase?"
    options:
      - "Proteins"
      - "Lipids"
      - "Nucleic acids"
      - "Carbohydrates"
      - "Nothing"
    correct: 4
    explanation: "**Nothing** is broken down by procarboxypeptidase. The 'pro-' prefix indicates it's an inactive enzyme precursor (zymogen). Procarboxypeptidase must first be activated into carboxypeptidase (by trypsin) before it can digest proteins. This is why zymogens are important - they prevent the pancreas from digesting itself."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "enzymes", "zymogens"]

  - question: "What does dipeptidase do?"
    options:
      - "Breaks down carbohydrates into monosaccharides"
      - "Activates pancreatic enzymes"
      - "Emulsifies fats for digestion"
      - "Breaksdown proteins into amino acids"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "Dipeptidase **finishes the breakdown of proteins into amino acids**. It's a brush border enzyme (located on the microvilli of the small intestine) that breaks dipeptides (two amino acids joined together) into individual amino acids. This is the final step of protein digestion - after trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase break proteins down into small peptides, dipeptidase completes the job."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "enzymes", "brush-border"]

  - question: "What is the monomer of proteins?"
    options:
      - "Fatty acids"
      - "Amino acids"
      - "Peptides"
      - "Monosaccharides"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "**Amino acids** are the monomers (building blocks) of proteins. When amino acids link together, they form peptides (2-50 amino acids) and polypeptides/proteins (50+ amino acids). Fatty acids are the building blocks of lipids, and monosaccharides are the building blocks of carbohydrates."
    tags: ["unit-4", "biochemistry", "proteins"]

  - question: "What do maltase, lactase, and sucrase have in common?"
    options:
      - "They are pancreatic enzymes that begin carbohydrate digestion"
      - "They are brush border enzymes that breakdown carbohydrates"
      - "They are stomach enzymes that digest complex carbohydrates"
      - "They are salivary enzymes that break down starches"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Maltase, lactase, and sucrase are **brush border enzymes** (located on the microvilli of the small intestine) that **complete carbohydrate digestion**. They break disaccharides into monosaccharides: maltase breaks maltose into glucose, lactase breaks lactose into glucose + galactose, and sucrase breaks sucrose into glucose + fructose. This is the final step - they're the 'finishers' of sugar digestion."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "enzymes", "brush-border", "carbohydrates"]

  - question: "Where would you most likely find maltase, lactase, and sucrase?"
    options:
      - "In the pancreas"
      - "In the stomach lining"
      - "In the small intestine"
      - "In the saliva"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "These enzymes are located **on the brush border** - the microvilli of the small intestine. Unlike pancreatic enzymes that are secreted into the intestinal lumen, brush border enzymes are attached to the surface of intestinal cells. This is where the final digestion of disaccharides happens, right before absorption."

  - question: "Secretin is a hormone secreted by the _______ that stimulates the release of _______."
    options:
      - "stomach, gastric acid"
      - "small intestine, pancreatic juices"
      - "pancreas, insulin"
      - "liver, bile"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "**Secretin** is a hormone secreted by the **small intestine** (specifically S cells in the duodenum) in response to acidic chyme from the stomach. It stimulates the pancreas to release **pancreatic juices** (bicarbonate-rich fluid) to neutralize stomach acid. This protects the small intestine from acid damage and creates the proper pH for digestive enzymes to work."

  - question: "Which organ, if partially removed, would cause the most problems for a person?"
    options:
      - "Large intestine"
      - "Stomach"
      - "Pancreas"
      - "Small intestine"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The **pancreas** would cause the most problems if partially removed because it has both exocrine and endocrine functions. Loss of exocrine function means decreased digestive enzyme production (affecting protein, fat, and carbohydrate digestion). Loss of endocrine function means impaired insulin and glucagon production, leading to difficulty regulating blood sugar (diabetes). The other organs can be partially removed with less severe consequences - the large intestine can be shortened, the stomach can be reduced (gastric bypass), and even portions of the small intestine can be removed with compensation."

# LIVER & BILE QUESTIONS:

  - question: "Which of the following is NOT a function of the liver?"
    options:
      - "Vitamin storage"
      - "Detoxification"
      - "Glycogen storage"
      - "Production of digestive enzymes"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "The liver performs many functions including **vitamin storage** (A, D, E, K, B12), **detoxification** of drugs and toxins, and **glycogen storage** for blood glucose regulation. However, the liver does NOT produce digestive enzymes - that's the pancreas's job (amylase, lipase, proteases)."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "liver"]

  - question: "The hepatic portal vein carries blood from the _______ to the _______."
    options:
      - "digestive organs, liver"
      - "liver, heart"
      - "heart, liver"
      - "liver, digestive organs"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "The **hepatic portal vein** carries nutrient-rich blood from the digestive organs (stomach, intestines, spleen, pancreas) to the liver for processing. This allows the liver to regulate nutrient levels, store vitamins and glycogen, and detoxify substances before blood enters general circulation."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "liver", "circulation"]

  - question: "Bile contains which of the following?"
    options:
      - "Digestive enzymes"
      - "Bilirubin"
      - "Bile salts"
      - "Both a and b"
      - "Both b and c"
    correct: 4
    explanation: "Bile contains **both bilirubin and bile salts**. Bilirubin is a waste product from broken-down red blood cells (gives bile its yellow-green color). Bile salts emulsify fats to aid digestion. Bile does NOT contain digestive enzymes - it's not enzymatic, just helps with fat breakdown."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "liver", "bile"]

  - question: "What is the primary function of bile?"
    options:
      - "Digest proteins"
      - "Emulsification of fats"
      - "Neutralize stomach acid"
      - "Absorb vitamins"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The primary function of bile is **emulsification of fats** - breaking large fat droplets into smaller droplets. This increases surface area for pancreatic lipase to work on. Bile salts act like detergent, allowing fats to mix with water and be digested/absorbed."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "bile", "lipids"]

  - question: "Where is bile produced and where is it stored?"
    options:
      - "Produced in gallbladder, stored in liver"
      - "Produced and stored in liver"
      - "Produced in liver, stored in gallbladder"
      - "Produced and stored in gallbladder"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Bile is **produced in the liver** by hepatocytes and **stored/concentrated in the gallbladder**. When you eat fatty foods, CCK signals the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the duodenum via the bile duct."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "liver", "gallbladder", "bile"]

  - question: "Which hormone stimulates the gallbladder to release bile?"
    options:
      - "Secretin"
      - "Gastrin"
      - "CCK"
      - "Insulin"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "**CCK (Cholecystokinin)** is released by the small intestine in response to fats and proteins. It stimulates the gallbladder to contract and release bile, and also stimulates the pancreas to release digestive enzymes. Secretin stimulates bicarbonate release, not bile."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "hormones", "gallbladder"]

  - question: "What characterizes 'ideal' stool?"
    options:
      - "Continuous log that sinks"
      - "Hard pellets that sink"
      - "Loose and floats"
      - "Dark with black specks"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "Ideal stool is a **continuous log that sinks** - smooth, soft, and easy to pass. Hard pellets indicate constipation. Floating stool can indicate excess fat (malabsorption). Ribbon-like stool can indicate obstruction."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "large-intestine", "clinical"]

  - question: "Why does the small intestine need so much surface area?"
    options:
      - "To secrete digestive enzymes"
      - "To store partially digested food"
      - "For nutrient absorption"
      - "For mechanical digestion"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The small intestine needs extensive surface area **for nutrient absorption**. The small intestine has three features that maximize surface area: circular folds (plicae circulares), villi (finger-like projections), and microvilli (on each epithelial cell forming the brush border). This creates about 200-250 square meters of surface area - roughly the size of a tennis court. The massive surface area allows efficient absorption of nutrients (amino acids, monosaccharides, fatty acids) into the bloodstream through the intestinal epithelium."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "small-intestine", "absorption", "anatomy"]

  - question: "How does the small intestine increase surface area?"
    options:
      - "Circular folds and villi"
      - "Villi and microvilli"
      - "Circular folds and microvilli"
      - "Circular folds, villi, and microvilli"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "The small intestine uses **three structural modifications** to maximize surface area: (1) **Circular folds (plicae circulares)** - permanent ridges in the mucosa that force chyme to spiral through the intestine, (2) **Villi** - finger-like projections of the mucosa that extend into the lumen, and (3) **Microvilli** - tiny projections on the apical surface of each epithelial cell that form the brush border. Together, these three features increase surface area by about 600 times, creating roughly 200-250 square meters for nutrient absorption."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "small-intestine", "absorption", "anatomy"]

  - question: "Why does the stomach only release small amounts of chyme at a time into the small intestine?"
    options:
      - "To prevent the stomach from emptying too quickly and causing hunger"
      - "To allow the liver to produce enough bile for fat digestion"
      - "The small intestine needs time to neutralize acid and process nutrients"
      - "To maximize protein digestion in the stomach before moving forward"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The stomach releases chyme in small amounts (controlled by the pyloric sphincter) because **the small intestine needs time to neutralize acid and process nutrients**. The acidic chyme (pH ~2) must be neutralized by pancreatic bicarbonate in the duodenum to prevent damage to the intestinal lining and create the proper pH (7-8) for pancreatic enzymes to function. Additionally, digestive enzymes need time to break down nutrients, and the intestine can only absorb nutrients at a certain rate. Releasing too much chyme at once would overwhelm these processes."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "stomach", "small-intestine", "regulation"]

  - question: "Why is the small intestine so long (approximately 20 feet)?"
    options:
      - "To store large amounts of food between meals"
      - "To allow enough time and space for digestion and absorption"
      - "To produce sufficient digestive enzymes for all nutrients"
      - "To prevent chyme from moving too quickly into the large intestine"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The small intestine is approximately 20 feet (6 meters) long **to allow enough time and space for complete digestion and absorption**. Chyme moves slowly through the small intestine (3-5 hours), giving pancreatic and brush border enzymes time to fully break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into absorbable units. The length also provides extensive surface area for nutrient absorption - by the time chyme reaches the end of the ileum, approximately 90% of nutrients and water have been absorbed into the bloodstream."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "small-intestine", "anatomy"]

  - question: "Why are there so many layers of folds (circular folds, villi, microvilli) in the small intestine?"
    options:
      - "To slow down chyme movement and increase digestion time"
      - "To provide structural support and prevent intestinal collapse"
      - "Nutrients need surface contact with epithelial cells for absorption"
      - "To secrete more digestive enzymes into the intestinal lumen"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The multiple layers of folds exist because **nutrients need surface contact with epithelial cells for absorption to occur**. Absorption happens when nutrients (amino acids, monosaccharides, fatty acids) come into contact with the intestinal epithelium and are transported across the cell membrane into the bloodstream. The circular folds, villi, and microvilli dramatically increase the surface area available for this contact - creating about 200-250 square meters of absorptive surface. More surface area means more contact points, allowing efficient absorption of the massive amount of nutrients consumed daily."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "small-intestine", "absorption", "anatomy"]

  - question: "What is the significance of the microscopic anatomy of the small intestine (villi and microvilli)?"
    options:
      - "Production and secretion of digestive enzymes into the lumen"
      - "Mechanical breakdown of large food particles through grinding"
      - "Transport of nutrients from chyme into the bloodstream"
      - "Neutralization of acidic chyme with bicarbonate secretions"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The microscopic anatomy of the small intestine (villi and microvilli) is designed for **transporting nutrients from chyme into the bloodstream** - the process of absorption. Each villus contains a capillary network and a lacteal (lymphatic vessel). When nutrients contact the epithelial cells on the microvilli (brush border), they are absorbed through the cell membrane. Amino acids and monosaccharides enter the capillaries and go to the hepatic portal vein. Fatty acids are packaged into chylomicrons and enter the lacteals. This is where nutrients finally enter the body from the digestive tract."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "small-intestine", "absorption", "anatomy"]

  - question: "Why is the liver so important for digestion?"
    options:
      - "It produces all the digestive enzymes needed for nutrient breakdown"
      - "It absorbs nutrients from the digestive tract into the bloodstream"
      - "Fats cannot be digested efficiently without bile salts from the liver"
      - "It neutralizes stomach acid before it enters the small intestine"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The liver is critical for digestion because **fats cannot be digested efficiently without bile salts**. The liver produces bile containing bile salts, which emulsify large fat droplets into smaller droplets. This emulsification dramatically increases the surface area available for pancreatic lipase to break down triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Without bile salts, dietary fats would remain in large droplets that lipase cannot effectively digest, leading to fat malabsorption and steatorrhea (fatty stools). The liver produces about 500-1000 mL of bile daily, which is stored and concentrated in the gallbladder."
    tags: ["unit-4", "digestive", "liver", "bile", "lipids"]

  - question: "Why is the gallbladder important for digestion?"
    options:
      - "It produces bile salts needed for emulsifying dietary fats"
      - "It secretes pancreatic enzymes that break down all macronutrients"
      - "Fat digestion is much slower and harder without the gallbladder"
      - "It stores and releases proteins needed for nutrient absorption"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "The gallbladder is important because **fat digestion is much slower and harder without it**. While the liver continuously produces bile, the gallbladder stores and concentrates it (removing water to make it 5-10 times more concentrated). When you eat a fatty meal, CCK triggers the gallbladder to contract and release a large, concentrated dose of bile into the duodenum. Without a gallbladder (post-cholecystectomy), bile drips continuously into the intestine in dilute form instead of being released in concentrated bursts when needed. This means fat digestion still occurs, but less efficiently - especially for high-fat meals, which can cause digestive discomfort and diarrhea."

  - question: "Which of the following would NOT be absorbed directly into the blood capillaries from the small intestine?"
    options:
      - "Amino acids"
      - "Glucose"
      - "Chylomicrons"
      - "Galactose"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "**Chylomicrons** do NOT enter blood capillaries directly - they are too large. Instead, chylomicrons (which contain repackaged triglycerides, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins) enter the lacteals (lymphatic vessels) in the villi. They travel through the lymphatic system and eventually enter the bloodstream at the thoracic duct. In contrast, amino acids and monosaccharides (glucose, galactose) are absorbed directly into the capillaries and go to the hepatic portal vein."

  # - question: "Which enzyme works in an alkaline (basic) environment?"
  #   options:
  #     - "Pepsin"
  #     - "Gastric lipase"
  #     - "Trypsin"
  #     - "Lingual lipase"
  #   correct: 2
  #   explanation: "**Trypsin** works in an alkaline environment (pH 7-8) in the small intestine. The pancreas secretes bicarbonate to neutralize acidic chyme, creating the alkaline conditions needed for pancreatic enzymes to function. Pepsin and gastric lipase work in the acidic stomach (pH 2), and lingual lipase works in the mouth (pH 6.8)."

  - question: "Which of the following IS a form of mechanical digestion?"
    options:
      - "Pepsin breaking down proteins"
      - "Segmentation in the small intestine"
      - "Amylase breaking down starches"
      - "Bile emulsifying fats"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "**Segmentation** IS mechanical digestion - it involves rhythmic contractions of circular muscles in the small intestine that physically mix and break down food particles. Pepsin and amylase are chemical digestion (enzymatic breakdown). Bile emulsification is physical but not considered mechanical digestion - it's emulsification that prepares fats for chemical digestion by lipase."

  - question: "Which of the following IS released from the brush border?"
    options:
      - "Pepsinogen"
      - "Trypsinogen"
      - "Lactase"
      - "Pancreatic amylase"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "**Lactase** IS a brush border enzyme - it's attached to the microvilli of the small intestine and breaks lactose into glucose and galactose. Pepsinogen is secreted by chief cells in the stomach. Trypsinogen and pancreatic amylase are secreted by the pancreas into the intestinal lumen, not from the brush border."

  - question: "Where in the small intestine are bile salts reabsorbed for recycling?"
    options:
      - "Duodenum"
      - "Jejunum"
      - "Ileum"
      - "They are not reabsorbed"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Bile salts are reabsorbed in the **ileum** (the last section of the small intestine). About 95% of bile salts are recycled through enterohepatic circulation - they are reabsorbed in the ileum and transported back to the liver via the hepatic portal vein to be used again. This efficient recycling system means the liver doesn't need to constantly synthesize new bile salts."

  - question: "Which brush border enzyme breaks down the smallest protein fragments?"
    options:
      - "Pepsin"
      - "Trypsin"
      - "Chymotrypsin"
      - "Dipeptidase"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "**Dipeptidase** breaks down the smallest protein fragments - dipeptides (2 amino acids joined together) - into individual amino acids. This is the final step of protein digestion. Pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin break larger proteins and polypeptides into smaller peptides, but dipeptidase completes the job by producing absorbable amino acids."

  - question: "Which of the following would be involved with carbohydrate digestion?"
    options:
      - "Lingual lipase"
      - "Pepsin"
      - "Pancreatic amylase"
      - "Trypsin"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "**Pancreatic amylase** digests carbohydrates (specifically starches and glycogen) by breaking them down into disaccharides like maltose. Lingual lipase digests fats. Pepsin and trypsin digest proteins. Salivary amylase also digests carbohydrates in the mouth, but pancreatic amylase does the majority of starch digestion in the small intestine."

  - question: "Where does protein digestion begin?"
    options:
      - "Oral cavity"
      - "Stomach"
      - "Small intestine"
      - "Large intestine"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Protein digestion begins in the **stomach**. Pepsin (activated from pepsinogen by HCl) breaks proteins into smaller polypeptides. No protein digestion occurs in the oral cavity - saliva only contains amylase for carbohydrates. Protein digestion continues in the small intestine with pancreatic enzymes and is completed by brush border enzymes."

  - question: "Which statement about lipid digestion is TRUE?"
    options:
      - "Micelles enter the lacteals for transport"
      - "Lipids are completely digested in the stomach"
      - "Bile salts are used to emulsify fat droplets"
      - "The large intestine produces enzymes for lipid digestion"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "**Bile salts ARE used to emulsify fat droplets** - this is true. Emulsification breaks large fat globules into smaller droplets, increasing surface area for pancreatic lipase to work. Micelles do NOT enter lacteals (they stay in the lumen and deliver fatty acids to cells; chylomicrons enter lacteals). Lipids are NOT completely digested in the stomach (most digestion occurs in the small intestine). The large intestine does NOT produce digestive enzymes."

  - question: "How do antihistamines affect the autonomic nervous system, and what side effect does this cause in the oral cavity?"
    answer: "Antihistamines block the parasympathetic nervous system by blocking the release of acetylcholine (Ach). Ach usually triggers acinar cells to release serous fluid (the liquidy part of saliva). The side effect is dry mouth."

  - question: "Explain why a proton pump (H+) inhibitor, such as Prilosec, relieves the symptoms of acid reflux?"
    answer: "Proton pump inhibitors block the H+/K+ ATPase pumps in parietal cells, which prevents them from secreting H+ ions (hydrochloric acid) into the stomach. With less acid in the stomach, there's less acidic content that can reflux back up into the esophagus, relieving the burning sensation and damage caused by acid reflux."

  - question: "Why do you get more easily drunk on an empty stomach?"
    answer: "On an empty stomach, alcohol is absorbed faster for two reasons: (1) Some alcohol gets absorbed directly through the stomach lining (more than usual since it's the only thing there), and (2) alcohol enters the small intestine faster because there's no food to slow gastric emptying. Since most alcohol absorption happens in the small intestine, reaching it quickly means the alcohol enters your bloodstream faster, making you feel drunk sooner and more intensely."

  - question: "Explain why gastric bypass patients need vitamin injections. What's going on with these patients? Include in your answer: (a.) which vitamin they need, (b.) which cells are missing and what those cells usually produce, and (c.) why reducing stomach size creates this problem."
    answer: "Parietal cells in the stomach produce intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor binds to vitamin B12 in the stomach and allows it to be absorbed later in the small intestine. Gastric bypass surgery dramatically reduces stomach size, which decreases the number of parietal cells available to produce intrinsic factor. Without enough intrinsic factor, patients cannot absorb vitamin B12 from food. Since B12 is essential for red blood cell production, patients must receive B12 injections that bypass the digestive system entirely and go directly into the bloodstream."

    answer: "<strong>A. SUGARS (Carbohydrates):</strong></br></br><strong>Oral Cavity:</strong> Salivary amylase (from salivary glands) begins breaking down starches into smaller polysaccharides and maltose.</br></br><strong>Stomach:</strong> Salivary amylase is deactivated by stomach acid. No carbohydrate digestion occurs here.</br></br><strong>Small Intestine:</strong> Pancreatic amylase (from pancreas) continues breaking down polysaccharides into disaccharides (maltose, lactose, sucrose).

  - question: "EXTRA CREDIT: The digestive system produces powerful enzymes and acid that can break down food, yet the system doesn't digest itself. Explain at least three (3) different mechanisms that prevent the digestive tract from being damaged by its own secretions."
    answer: "The digestive system uses multiple protective mechanisms: (1) **Zymogens** - Protein-digesting enzymes are secreted as inactive precursors (like pepsinogen and trypsinogen) and only activated when needed, preventing them from digesting the organs that produce them. (2) **Mucus secretion** - Goblet cells secrete a thick mucus layer that coats the stomach and intestinal lining, creating a physical barrier between digestive enzymes/acid and the epithelial cells. (3) **Bicarbonate neutralization** - The stomach and pancreas secrete bicarbonate (HCO3-) which neutralizes acid, especially important in the duodenum where pancreatic bicarbonate protects the small intestine from acidic chyme. (4) **Tight junctions** - Epithelial cells are connected by tight junctions that prevent acid and enzymes from leaking between cells to the underlying tissue. (5) **Rapid cell turnover** - The stomach and intestinal lining is replaced every 3-5 days, so any damaged cells are quickly shed and replaced."
