multipleChoice:
  - question: "Bringing nutrients into the body is the process of ________."
    options:
      - "Ingestion"
      - "Propulsion"
      - "Secretion"
      - "Absorption"
    correct: 3
    explanation: "Ingestion is bringing it into the alimentary canal (still outside the body). Propulsion moves it through the alimentary canal. Secretion is putting things into the alimentary canal (e.g. mucous, enzymes). **Absorption is the process of bringing things from the digestive tract into the blood (from ouside the body into the body)**."

essay:

  - question: "Which autonomic nervous system does taking antihistamines work on and what would be the side effect of these drugs to the oral cavity?"
    answer: "Works on the parasympathetic. Blocks release of Ach, which triggers acinar cells to release serous fluid, so the side effect is dry mouth."
