  - question: "People who get cirrhosis (fibrosis) of the liver often get swelling of the abdomen (ascites), edema, and easily bruise. Why might that be the case?"
    answer: "Their damaged liver can't produce enough albumin or fibrinogen. Inadequate albumin leads to swelling and edema which is apparent as swelling of the abdomen. Low fibrinogen leads to not enough clotting and they get bruising from even minor tissue damage."

  - question: "The compounds thromboxan and prostacyclin have opposing effects on the clotting process. Describe the action of each."
    answer: "Thromboxane is released by platelets and increases their stickiness encouraging platelet plug formation. Prostacyclin is an anti-coagulant that inhibits thrombin and reduces coagulation (it's an anticoagulant)."

  - question: "When does an Rh negative person (Rh-) begin to produce anti-D antibodies? Explain why this timing is different from the ABO blood group system."
    answer: "Rh negative people only begin to produce anti-D antibodies after initial exposure to Rh positive blood. This is different from the ABO system because people are born with ABO antibodies without any prior exposure. The Rh system requires sensitization - the first exposure creates memory cells that will produce antibodies upon subsequent exposures."

  - question: "A mom with type AB blood and a dad with type O+ blood are having a baby. Could the baby have A- blood? Why? (Draw two punnet squares, one for the ABO type and one for the Rh type.)"
    answer: "Yes, the baby could have A- blood. The mom (AB) can contribute either I^A or I^B allele, and the dad (O) can only contribute i allele. This gives possible blood types A or B (not AB or O). For Rh, if the dad is Dd (heterozygous), he can contribute d, and if mom is also Dd or dd, the baby could be dd (Rh negative). Therefore A- is possible."

  - question: describe the clotting pathway, extrinsic and intrinsic braches as well as the common pathway. Draw a flow chart showing the sequence and the factors if you prefer (don't use abreviations).
    answer: extrinsic pathway, intrinsic pathway, common pathway

  - question: "Answer the following questions based on the Wigger's graph:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A) What is it called and what is happening?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) Is this ventricular or atrial pressure (top line)? Why?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C) Are the atria in systole or diastole in this region? How do you know?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D) Of the four phases of the cardiac cycle, what does D represent?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E) What is E?"
    image: "exam-2/wiggers.jpg"
    answer: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A) P wave; atrial depolarization<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) Ventricular, higher than atria during IC phase <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C) Systole (higher pressure than ventricles and after P wave) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D) Isovolumetric relaxation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E) End Diastolic Volume (EDV)."

  - question: "Answer the following questions based on the Wigger's graph: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) What is it called and what is happening? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) What is happening at this point? What phase begins after this happens? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C) What is this point called? What does it represent (measure)?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D) What is this point called? When you subract it from the previous measurment what do you calculate? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E) What phase is represented by E, and which chamber is measured?"
    image: "exam-2/wiggers2.jpg"
    answer: "A. T wave - ventricular repolarization. </br> B. Atrioventricular valve closes, isovolumetric contraction begins. </br> C. End Diastolic Volume (EDV), the volume of blood at the end of ventricular filling (preload).</br> D. End Systolic Volume (ESV) which is the volume of blood at the end of ventricular ejection. </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDV - ESV = Stroke Volume (SV)</br> E. Isovolumetric relaxation, pressure in the left ventricle."

  - question: "Describe the process of capillary exchange (draw and label a diagram if it's helpful)."
    answer: "Capillary exchange occurs through filtration and reabsorption. At the arteriole end, hydrostatic pressure (HP) exceeds blood colloid osmotic pressure (BCOP), causing net filtration of fluid, nutrients, and oxygen into tissues. At the venule end, BCOP exceeds HP, causing net reabsorption of fluid, waste products, and CO2 back into the blood. This process maintains fluid balance and facilitates nutrient/waste exchange."
