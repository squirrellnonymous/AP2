essay:
  - question: "People who get cirrhosis (fibrosis) of the liver often get swelling of the abdomen (ascites), edema, and easily bruise. Why might that be the case?"
    answer: "Their damaged liver can't produce enough albumin or fibrinogen. Inadequate albumin leads to swelling and edema which is apparent as swelling of the abdomen. Low fibrinogen leads to not enough clotting and they get bruising from even minor tissue damage."

  - question: "When does an Rh negative person (Rh-) begin to produce anti-D antibodies? Explain why this timing is different from the ABO blood group system."
    answer: "Rh negative people only begin to produce anti-D antibodies after initial exposure to Rh positive blood. This is different from the ABO system because people are born with ABO antibodies without any prior exposure. The Rh system requires sensitization - the first exposure creates memory cells that will produce antibodies upon subsequent exposures."
