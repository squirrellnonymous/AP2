  - question: "Why are erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets collectively called 'formed elements'?"
    options:
      - "They are all produced in the kidney."
      - "They are fully functional, true cells."
      - "Technically, most are not true cells (e.g., erythrocytes lack a nucleus, platelets are&nbsp;fragments)."

  - question: "Why do babies with Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN) often present with an enlarged spleen and jaundice?"
    options:
      - "The mother's antibodies cause high viscosity, damaging the organs."
      - "The liver is working overtime to produce fibrinogen."
      - "The spleen is working overtime to clean the blood of mass erythrocyte waste, causing bilirubin buildup (jaundice)."
      - "The kidney is failing to produce Erythropoietin."
    correct: 2

essay:
  - question: "People who get cirrhosis (fibrosis) of the liver often get swelling of the abdomen (ascites), edema, and easily bruise. Why might that be the case?"
    answer: "Their damaged liver can't produce enough albumin or fibrinogen. Inadequate albumin leads to swelling and edema which is apparent as swelling of the abdomen. Low fibrinogen leads to not enough clotting and they get bruising from even minor tissue damage."

  - question: "When does an Rh negative person (Rh-) begin to produce anti-D antibodies? Explain why this timing is different from the ABO blood group system."
    answer: "Rh negative people only begin to produce anti-D antibodies after initial exposure to Rh positive blood. This is different from the ABO system because people are born with ABO antibodies without any prior exposure. The Rh system requires sensitization - the first exposure creates memory cells that will produce antibodies upon subsequent exposures."
