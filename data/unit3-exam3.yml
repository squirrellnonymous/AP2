multipleChoice:
  - question: "As you move from primary bronchi toward the respiratory bronchioles, what happens?"
    options:
      - "There is less smooth muscle"
      - "There is less cartilage"
      - "There is less pseudostratified columnar"
      - "Both A and C"
      - "Both B and C"
    correct: 4
    explanation: "As airways get smaller, cartilage decreases (gone by bronchioles) and epithelium transitions from pseudostratified columnar to simple cuboidal/squamous. Smooth muscle actually increases proportionally."

  - question: "Loop diuretics directly __________ and therefore _________ urine production."
    options:
      - "Inhibit aquaporins; increase"
      - "Inhibit aquaporins; decrease"
      - "Inhibit Na/K/Cl symporter; increase"
      - "Inhibit Na/K/Cl symporter; decrease"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Loop diuretics block the Na/K/Cl symporter in the loop of Henle, preventing salt reabsorption. This keeps water in the tubule, increasing urine output."

  - question: "Which of the following situations would increase GFR?"
    options:
      - "Granular cells release renin"
      - "Release of epinephrine"
      - "Myogenic mechanism causes vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "Renin activates RAAS, leading to angiotensin II which constricts the efferent arteriole more than the afferent, maintaining/increasing GFR. Epinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole would decrease GFR."

  - question: "Which statement below is true?"
    options:
      - "Most water gain comes from catabolism"
      - "When a person drinks a lot of water, cells will lose water"
      - "The greatest volume of water is located in intracellular compartments"
      - "Water intake and thirst stop once blood osmolarity is lowered back to normal"
      - "All of the above"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "About 2/3 of body water is intracellular. Most water gain comes from drinking (not catabolism). Drinking water dilutes blood, causing cells to gain water (not lose it). Thirst stops before osmolarity fully normalizes."

  - question: "Most CO₂ is in the bloodstream"
    options:
      - "As a Gas"
      - "Held by hemoglobin"
      - "As Carbonic acid"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "About 70% of CO2 is converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) by carbonic anhydrase. ~23% binds hemoglobin, ~7% dissolves as gas."

  - question: "Which of the following hormones works to increase water reabsorption in the collecting duct?"
    options:
      - "Antidiuretic hormone"
      - "Aldosterone"
      - "Angiotensin II"
      - "Epinephrine"
      - "All of the above"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "ADH (vasopressin) inserts aquaporins into collecting duct cells, allowing water reabsorption. Aldosterone affects Na+ reabsorption (DCT), not direct water reabsorption in collecting duct."
    tags: ["unit-3", "urinary", "hormones"]

  - question: "Which of the following is not reabsorbed by the proximal convoluted tubule?"
    options:
      - "Potassium ions"
      - "Hydrogen ions"
      - "Sodium ions"
      - "Amino acids"
      - "Glucose"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Hydrogen ions are SECRETED (not reabsorbed) by the PCT to help regulate blood pH. The PCT reabsorbs sodium, potassium, glucose, amino acids, and other nutrients, but it actively secretes H+ ions into the tubule to maintain acid-base balance."
    tags: ["unit-3", "urinary", "PCT"]

  - question: "During the Bohr shift, which factor would decrease the affinity of oxygen by hemoglobin?"
    options:
      - "Decreased temperature"
      - "Decreased CO₂"
      - "Decreased pH"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Decreased pH (more acidic) causes hemoglobin to release O2 more easily. This happens in active tissues with high CO2/H+ levels, facilitating oxygen delivery where needed."
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory", "bohr-shift"]

  - question: "An **increase** in _________ will slow down gas exchange between the blood and alveolar air?"
    options:
      - "membrane thickness"
      - "alveolar surface area"
      - "respiratory rate"
      - "oxygen solubility"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "Thicker membranes (like in pulmonary edema or fibrosis) increase diffusion distance, slowing gas exchange. Increased surface area, respiratory rate, and solubility would all speed it up."
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory", "gas-exchange"]

  - question: "A **decrease** in _________ will slow down gas exchange between the blood and **alveolar oxygen**?"
    options:
      - "atmospheric pressure"
      - "alveolar surface area"
      - "respiratory rate"
      - "oxygen concentration"
      - "all of the above"
    correct: 4
    explanation: "All of these would slow down gas exchange between alveolar O₂ and blood O₂"
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory", "gas-exchange"]

  - question: "Chronic hypoventilation will result in"
    options:
      - "Respiratory alkalosis"
      - "Respiratory acidosis"
      - "No change"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Hypoventilation = not breathing enough → CO2 builds up → carbonic acid increases → pH drops → acidosis. Hyperventilation would cause alkalosis."
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory", "acid-base"]

  - question: "In the RAAS system, Angiotensin II"
    options:
      - "Is converted from Angiotensin I with the aid of ACE"
      - "Decreases the feeling of thirst"
      - "Promotes Na and water secretion in the PCT"
      - "Promotes widespread vasodilation"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Ang II increases thirst, promotes Na+ reabsorption (not secretion), and causes vasoconstriction (not vasodilation)."
    tags: ["unit-3", "urinary", "RAAS"]

  - question: "Sodium"
    options:
      - "Is responsible for repolarization of cells during an action potential"
      - "The major cation in the intracellular fluid"
      - "Is reabsorbed less when atrial natriuretic peptides are released"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) inhibits Na+ reabsorption to decrease blood volume/pressure. K+ (not Na+) repolarizes cells, and K+ (not Na+) is the major intracellular cation."
    tags: ["unit-3", "electrolytes"]

  - question: "During expiration, ________ pressure is higher than ___________ pressure."
    options:
      - "Intrapulmonary; atmospheric"
      - "Atmospheric; intrapulmonary"
      - "Intrapleural; intrapulmonary"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "During expiration, air flows OUT of lungs because intrapulmonary pressure becomes higher than atmospheric pressure. Air always flows from high to low pressure."
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory", "pressures"]

  - question: "Some tumors secrete a large amount of ADH, which would result in which type of fluid disturbance?"
    options:
      - "Hypervolemia"
      - "Hypovolemia"
      - "Hypotonic hydration"
      - "Dehydration"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Excess ADH causes excessive water reabsorption, diluting body fluids (hypotonic = too much water relative to solutes). This is called SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH)."
    tags: ["unit-3", "fluid-balance", "ADH"]

  - question: "How is alveolar air different than inspired air?"
    options:
      - "Alveolar air has a higher PCO2 than inspired air."
      - "Alveolar air has a higher PO2 than inspired air."
      - "Alveolar air has a lower PH2O than inhaled air."
      - "All of the above"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "Alveolar air has higher CO2 (from tissue respiration), lower O2 (being absorbed), and higher water vapor (from humidification) compared to inspired atmospheric air."
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory"]

  - question: "How do the kidneys compensate respiratory acidosis?"
    options:
      - "By secreting more bicarbonate ions"
      - "By secreting more hydrogen ions"
      - "By secreting more sodium ions"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "To compensate for respiratory acidosis (too much CO2/H+), kidneys secrete MORE H+ into urine and reabsorb MORE bicarbonate to buffer the blood pH back up."
    tags: ["unit-3", "acid-base", "urinary"]

  - question: "Surfactant"
    options:
      - "Is produced by Type I alveolar cells"
      - "Helps to reduce surface tension"
      - "Helps to bronchoconstrict"
      - "All of the above"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Surfactant is produced by Type II alveolar cells (not Type I) and reduces surface tension to prevent alveolar collapse. It does not affect bronchodilation/constriction."
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory", "surfactant"]

  - question: "In the PCT, which of the following is not a way Na+ moves?"
    options:
      - "Na+/glucose symport"
      - "Na+/H+ symport"
      - "Na+/K+ pump"
      - "Na+/bicarb symport"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Na+/H+ is an ANTIport (exchanger), not a symport. Na+ goes in while H+ goes out in opposite directions. The others (glucose, bicarb) move in the same direction as Na+ (symport)."
    tags: ["unit-3", "urinary", "PCT"]

  - question: "Nitrogen has _______ partial pressure and __________ solubility, which is why it is not found in high concentrations in the blood stream."

      - "High; Low"
      - "Low; Low"
      - "Low; High"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "N2 makes up ~78% of air (high partial pressure) but is very inert with low solubility in blood. Only O2 and CO2 dissolve/transport well enough to be physiologically relevant."
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory", "gas-exchange"]

  - question: "Which of the following hormones decrease blood pressure?"
    options:
      - "Angiotensin II"
      - "Atrial natriuretic peptides"
      - "Epinephrine"
      - "Aldosterone"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "ANP is released when atria are stretched (high blood volume/pressure) and causes Na+/water loss to decrease blood volume and pressure. The others all increase blood pressure."
    tags: ["unit-3", "fluid-balance", "hormones"]

  - question: "The urge to breathe again while holding your breath largely comes from"
    options:
      - "Build up of carbon dioxide"
      - "Decrease in oxygen"
      - "Both equally"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "Central chemoreceptors are most sensitive to CO2/H+ changes. The urge to breathe is primarily driven by CO2 buildup, not O2 decrease (peripheral chemoreceptors respond to low O2 but less urgently)."
    tags: ["unit-3", "respiratory", "control"]

  - question: "Sensible water loss includes"
    options:
      - "Loss through skin evaporation"

      - "Feces"
      - "All of the above"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Sensible = measurable/visible water loss (urine, feces, sweat). Insensible = unmeasurable loss through skin evaporation and breath. Feces is the only sensible loss listed."
    tags: ["unit-3", "fluid-balance"]

  - question: "Hyperkalemia (mild) will"
    options:
      - "Make cells more excitable"
      - "Make cells less excitable"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "High extracellular K+ makes resting membrane potential less negative (closer to threshold), so cells fire more easily. Severe hyperkalemia can actually prevent firing by inactivating Na+ channels."

  - question: "Blast from the past: The zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex produces:"
    options:
      - "Cortisol"
      - "Aldosterone"
      - "Androgens"
      - "Epinephrine"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Zona glomerulosa produces aldosterone (salt/mineral regulation). Zona fasciculata makes cortisol (sugar/stress). Zona reticularis makes androgens (sex). Medulla makes epinephrine. Aldosterone works on the kidneys to increase NaCl reabsorption in the DCT, then water follows. This results in increased blood pressure due to increased blood volume"

  - question: "What effect does hyperventilation have on blood pH?"
    options:
      - "Increases pH (alkalosis)"
      - "Decreases pH (acidosis)"
      - "No effect on pH"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "Hyperventilation blows off excess CO2, reducing carbonic acid in blood, which raises pH causing respiratory alkalosis. This is why breathing into a paper bag helps - it increases CO2 to normalize pH."

  - question: "During exercise, what happens to blood flow to the kidneys?"
    options:
      - "Increases significantly"
      - "Decreases due to sympathetic vasoconstriction"
      - "Stays the same"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "During exercise, sympathetic stimulation causes vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles, reducing renal blood flow and GFR. Blood is redirected to skeletal muscles and heart. This is why you shouldn't drink too much before running!"

essay:

  - question: "Name three functions of the kidneys (other than the production of urine)."
    answer: "The kidney has several functions in addition to just making urine including: water conservation, the kidneys filter the blood, regulate blood pressure, regulate electrolyte balance, regulate blood volume, rid the body of waste products (hydrogen ions, urea, amonia...), regulate blood pH, ...and if you didn't catch it... water conservation."

  - question: "You have just landed in Cusco, Peru where the altitude is 11,000 ft (3,350 m) above sea level and the overall atmospheric pressure is 524 mmHg (compared to 760 mmHg at sea level). Your otherwise healthy companion who lives at sea level is having a hard time catching her breath and has become very irritable and is complaining of a headache. Why is it hard for her to breathe? Explain this using Dalton's and Henry's Laws."
    answer: "Since the overall pressure is lower the partial pressure of O2 in the air is lower (so is the pp of CO2 and N2). The gradient between the partial pressure of O2 in her blood has become weaker relative to the alveolar pressure (which is infuenced by the pp of O2 in the air). It's hard for her to breath because she isn't absorbing enough O2 into her blood to be able to fully oxygenate her blood and she is suffering from hypoxia. Ideally you can travel to a lower altitude where the pressure gradient will be stronger and she can acclimate to the altitude by producing more red blood cells and oxygenate her tissues. Dalton's Law explains why the partial pressure went down when the overall pressure went down because the totat pressure is the sum of the partial pressures. Henry's law explains why it's making it harder to absorb O2 into solution now that it has a lower partial pressure. The solubility and the partial pressure determine the amount to which a gas will go into solution and the partial pressure is lower."
