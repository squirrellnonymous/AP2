    answer: "A. T wave - ventricular repolarization. </br> B. Atrioventricular valve closes, isovolumetric contraction begins. </br> C. End Diastolic Volume (EDV), the volume of blood at the end of ventricular filling (preload).</br> D. End Systolic Volume (ESV) which is the volume of blood at the end of ventricular ejection. </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDV - ESV = Stroke Volume (SV)</br> E. Isovolumetric relaxation, pressure in the left ventricle."
